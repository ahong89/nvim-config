# Description
This is my config for nvim that I will continually update as things change.

# How to use
Make a new folder called nvim in the .config folder i.e.:\
```~/.config/nvim```\
Then clone the repo's contents into the new folder with:\
```git clone https://github.com/ahong89/nvim-config .```\
Be sure to include the dot as to ensure git does not make an nvim-config folder\
